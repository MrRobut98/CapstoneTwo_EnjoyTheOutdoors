Project Overview:
I successfully developed a multi-page website focusing on the great outdoors, featuring distinct pages for home, parks, and mountains. The navigation bar seamlessly links these sections, providing users with a cohesive browsing experience.

Parks Page - Dropdowns and Dynamic Content:
Implemented select tags for states and types with corresponding IDs for dynamic JavaScript manipulation.
Utilized arrays to dynamically populate the dropdowns with states and park types.
Created functions to filter national parks based on selected states and types, providing users with relevant information.
Mountains Page - Dropdown and Dynamic Content:
Employed a straightforward approach to populate a dropdown for mountain names using a forEach loop on the mountains array.
Implemented an onchange function to display detailed information about the selected mountain, enhancing user engagement.
Home Page - Carousel and Styling:
Utilized Bootstrap's carousel component for an engaging display of images on the home page.
Stylishly organized content, adjusting font sizes, and applying blur effects for aesthetic appeal.
Challenges and Future Improvements:
Despite the successful implementation, encountered challenges with adding buttons to carousel slides and displaying images for each mountain. Future improvements may include resolving these challenges, refining the UI/UX, and possibly adding additional features for an enhanced user experience.

Conclusion:
In summary, the project showcases proficiency in web development, incorporating essential elements such as navigation, dynamic content, and visual appeal. While there are areas for improvement, the foundation is strong, offering a solid platform for further enhancements.
