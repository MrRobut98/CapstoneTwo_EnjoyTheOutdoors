Mountains Page - Dropdown and Dynamic Content:
Employed a straightforward approach to populate a dropdown for mountain names using a forEach loop on the mountains array.
Implemented an onchange function to display detailed information about the selected mountain, enhancing user engagement.
Home Page - Carousel and Styling:
Utilized Bootstrap's carousel component for an engaging display of images on the home page.
Stylishly organized content, adjusting font sizes, and applying blur effects for aesthetic appeal.
Challenges and Future Improvements:
Despite the successful implementation, encountered challenges with adding buttons to carousel slides and displaying images for each mountain. Future improvements may include resolving these challenges, refining the UI/UX, and possibly adding additional features for an enhanced user experience.
